Homework

This is my first homework assignment for the class.

I've been severely ill with the flu, and have been mostly bedridden. At first it was just a severe cough that almost cleared, but I have incurred an secondary infection. It has been extremely hard to focus, so I've chosen the easier homework assignment. I've had to review and practice more than anything to make sure it has sunk in with the state I'm in (going on almost 2 weeks now). Regretfully I haven't been able to join the rest of the class in working on this homework assignment either, but I look forward to when I am better.

I've reviewed all class material multiple times, slides, assignments, etc. I have especially focused on the lesson "Heroes of CSS", since that's where I was having the most difficulty. I've redone the "Floats in CSS" activity 4 times just to make sure that I have it down. I have also done additional reading at https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/ and have watched various youtube videos, and practiced on my own in sublime.
